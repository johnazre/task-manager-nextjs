This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Project Details

Building a simple yet functional web application is a great way to learn Next.js, as it allows you to understand the framework's key concepts such as routing, server-side rendering, and data fetching. Here's a suggestion for a good app to build to learn Next.js:

### Task Management App

**Description:**
Create a task management application where users can add, view, update, and delete tasks. Tasks should have properties such as title, description, due date, priority, and status.

**Features:**
1. **Authentication:** Implement user authentication using Next.js authentication libraries like NextAuth.js or Auth0.
2. **Task Dashboard:** Display a dashboard where users can see all their tasks grouped by categories such as "To-Do," "In Progress," and "Completed."
3. **CRUD Operations:** Allow users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on tasks.
4. **Sorting and Filtering:** Enable users to sort tasks by due date, priority, or status. Also, implement filtering options.
5. **Server-side Rendering:** Utilize Next.js's server-side rendering capabilities for better performance and SEO.
6. **Responsive Design:** Ensure the application is responsive and works well on various devices and screen sizes.
7. **Data Persistence:** Store task data in a database (you can use MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or any other database of your choice) and use Next.js API routes for handling CRUD operations.
8. **Error Handling:** Implement error handling for various scenarios such as failed data fetching, invalid input, etc.
9. **Pagination:** If the number of tasks grows, implement pagination to display tasks in manageable chunks.
10. **Notifications:** Notify users about task updates, deadlines, etc., using notifications.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Learn how to set up Next.js project structure and routing.
- Understand how to work with Next.js API routes for server-side logic.
- Gain experience with React components and state management.
- Explore authentication and authorization concepts in Next.js.
- Practice working with databases and data fetching in Next.js.
- Improve knowledge of CSS for styling the application.

By building this task management app, you'll gain practical experience with Next.js while also creating a useful application that can be expanded and enhanced further. Additionally, you'll cover a range of fundamental concepts that are crucial for web development.

## Entities
In your task management application, you'll need to define several entities to represent the data you'll be working with. Here's a suggestion for the entities and their properties:

1. **User:**
   - ID: Unique identifier for each user.
   - Username: User's username for authentication.
   - Email: User's email address for authentication.
   - Password: Securely hashed password for authentication.

2. **Task:**
   - ID: Unique identifier for each task.
   - Title: Title or name of the task.
   - Description: Detailed description of the task.
   - Due Date: Deadline or due date for the task.
   - Priority: Priority level of the task (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
   - Status: Current status of the task (e.g., To-Do, In Progress, Completed).
   - Created By: Reference to the user who created the task.
   - Assigned To: Reference to the user to whom the task is assigned.

3. **Category:**
   - ID: Unique identifier for each category.
   - Name: Name of the category (e.g., To-Do, In Progress, Completed).
   - Description: Description of the category (optional).

4. **Comment:**
   - ID: Unique identifier for each comment.
   - Task ID: Reference to the task to which the comment belongs.
   - User ID: Reference to the user who posted the comment.
   - Content: Text content of the comment.
   - Timestamp: Timestamp indicating when the comment was posted.

5. **Notification:**
   - ID: Unique identifier for each notification.
   - User ID: Reference to the user to whom the notification is targeted.
   - Content: Text content of the notification.
   - Timestamp: Timestamp indicating when the notification was created.
   - Read Status: Indicates whether the notification has been read by the user.

These entities will allow you to represent users, tasks, categories, comments, and notifications within your application. Depending on the complexity and specific requirements of your application, you may need to adjust or expand these entities further. Additionally, you'll need to establish relationships between these entities, such as users owning tasks, tasks belonging to categories, comments associated with tasks, and notifications targeted at specific users.
